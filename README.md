# Hexabot Template Using Ludwig NLU

Welcome to the **Hexabot Template Ludwig** repository! This template provides everything you need to get started with building a custom Hexabot project adding the [Hexabot NLU Engine](https://github.com/Hexastack/hexabot-ludwig-nlu/). It includes essential folders and files to help you extend Hexabot, define your own modules, and quickly run your project in Docker. Below you'll find details on the structure and how to use this template.

Not familiar with [Hexabot](https://hexabot.ai/) ? It's an open-source chatbot / agent solution that allows users to create and manage AI-powered, multi-channel, and multilingual chatbots with ease. If you would like to learn more, please visit the [official github repo](https://github.com/Hexastack/Hexabot/).

## Project Structure

- **extensions/**: This folder is where you can develop your own extensions for Hexabot. Inside, you'll find subfolders for:

  - **channels/**: Add new messaging channels.
  - **helpers/**: Add helper functions or utilities.
  - **plugins/**: Create plugins to create custom blocks in the visual editor. Plugins is where you can perform text-to-action and integrate with 3rd party APIs. To get started, there is a `hello` plugin provided as an example.

- **modules/**: Since Hexabot API is built on top of NestJS, this folder allows you to extend the Hexabot API by adding your own modules (controllers, services, etc.).

- **Dockerfile**: Use this file to build a Docker image on top of Hexabot. It's pre-configured to get your project up and running in a containerized environment.

- **docker/docker-compose.yml**: This file defines the services needed to run your Hexabot project using Docker Compose. It simplifies the setup of multiple services such as databases or other dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Hexabot CLI**:
   To create a new Hexabot project, first install the Hexabot CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g hexabot-cli
   ```

2. **Create Your Project**:
   Use the Hexabot CLI to create a new chatbot project:

   ```bash
   hexabot create my-chatbot --template Hexastack/hexabot-template-ludwig
   ```

3. **Configure Your Environment**:

   - Initialize your newly created chatbot project  

   ```bash
   cd my-chatbot
   hexabot init
   ```
   Make sure you customize your `.env` file in `./my-chatbot/docker` directory and tailor it accordingly
   to your needs.

4. **Run the Project**:
   Navigate into the newly created folder and run the following command to start the project in development mode:

   ```bash
   hexabot dev --services ludwig-nlu,ollama
   ```

   For production mode, you can use:

   ```bash
   hexabot start --services ludwig-nlu,ollama
   ```

   _Note_: The first run may take some time as it needs to download all required Docker images.

5. **Configure your NLU Engine**:
   After creating your new project, the **Hexabot Ludwig NLU Engine** will be added by default. This NLU engine relies on the [Hexabot Helper Ludwig], you can enable it by following the steps detailed in [Ludwig NLU Engine](https://docs.hexabot.ai/user-guide/nlu/nlu-engines/ludwig-nlu-engine) documentation page:

## Built-in Features
